# Kloud + Clisonix

Executive overview of the current integration between `Clisonix` and `Kloud`.

---

## Single Source of Truth (Canonical)

Use only the paths below as active production sources:

- Runtime service: `services/kloud_bridge`
- Frontend module: `apps/web/app/modules/kloud-bridge`
- API routes: `apps/web/app/api/kloud-bridge` and `apps/web/app/api/proxy/kloud-bridge`
- Hardware SoC: `hardware/kloud-soc`
- CI pipeline: `.github/workflows/kloud-edge-ci.yml`

Legacy import mirrors are **not** production sources:

- `_imports/Kloud-web8-master`
- `_imports/Kloud-web8-pr`

Rule: if there is any mismatch, canonical paths above always win.

## Core Positioning

`Clisonix` and `Kloud` are designed to work **together in architecture, not merged in code**.

- **Clisonix** = product layer, AI workflows, customer experience, enterprise APIs
- **Kloud** = sovereign runtime, distributed trust fabric, secure coordination layer
- **kloud-bridge** = isolated gateway connecting the two

---

## What Has Already Been Done

- created shared `packages/nanogrid` interop package
- created `scripts/sync-nanogrid-profile.ps1` for reusable cross-repo sync
- created isolated `services/kloud_bridge` microservice
- added customer-facing `Kloud Bridge` module in the frontend
- enforced **live-only** behavior with no fake/demo values in production-facing flows

## Current Status

| Area | State |
| --- | --- |
| Architecture direction | ✅ decided |
| Bridge layer | ✅ created |
| Frontend module | ✅ created |
| Real-only production posture | ✅ enforced |
| Live upstream connectivity | ⏳ needs environment wiring |

---

## Why This Matters

This model gives the platform:

- stronger IP separation
- cleaner security boundaries
- enterprise-ready modular deployment
- a better path for future licensing and packaging

---

## Next Priorities

1. Configure the real `KLOUD_UPSTREAM_URL`
2. Keep `kloud-bridge` supervised and health-checked
3. expose only customer-relevant data in public views
4. add admin-only diagnostics and access control

## One-Line Summary

**Clisonix is the intelligent product layer; Kloud is the sovereign fabric underneath it.**
