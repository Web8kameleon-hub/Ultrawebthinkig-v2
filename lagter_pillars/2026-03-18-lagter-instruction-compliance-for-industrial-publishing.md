# Lagter Instruction Compliance for Industrial Publishing

## Executive Summary
This note documents how Lagter aligns content generation and publishing behavior with operator instructions in a production AI pipeline. The objective is simple: every published article must remain deterministic, auditable, and aligned with explicit user constraints.

## Why Compliance Matters
In mixed human-AI publishing workflows, the biggest risk is drift: generated content may become generic, over-promotional, or detached from the requested scope. Lagter addresses this by converting instructions into concrete acceptance checks before publication.

## Compliance Rules Used in This Run
Lagter applies the following checks:

1. **Scope fidelity**
   - The article must stay inside the requested domain (AI, EEG analytics, industrial intelligence, compliance).
   - Out-of-scope sections are rejected.

2. **Operational clarity**
   - The article must include concrete operational steps, not only abstract statements.
   - Claims must be linked to measurable signals where possible.

3. **Auditability**
   - The final content should be traceable to a source context and publication event.
   - Timestamps and source identifiers are preserved in the pipeline metadata.

4. **Production safety**
   - Placeholder text and incomplete sections are blocked.
   - Non-publishable markers trigger rejection before indexing.

## Practical Application
For this publication cycle, the generation output is validated against instruction-fit and publishability checks, then routed through blog publisher and LinkedIn poster services. If no pending content exists, the cycle exits safely without synthetic filler.

## Quality Signal Framework
Lagter uses lightweight deterministic quality signals:
- instruction coverage score,
- structure completeness score,
- content hygiene score,
- publication readiness decision.

Only outputs passing readiness criteria are promoted to the public blog.

## Closing Note
This article is intentionally concise and operational. Its role is to demonstrate that instruction compliance is enforced as a first-class requirement in the Clisonix publishing pipeline, not as an afterthought.
