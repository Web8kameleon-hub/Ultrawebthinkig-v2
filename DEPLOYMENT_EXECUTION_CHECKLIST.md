## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING PHASE (If Issues Occur)

### ⚠️ During Deployment Script

**Issue**: Script fails or hangs

- [ ] Check error message displayed
- [ ] Run verification immediately:

  ```bash
  python verify_ocean_core_v2.py --host 46.225.14.83
  ```

- [ ] Check logs:

  ```bash
  ssh root@46.225.14.83 "docker logs clisonix-ocean-core 2>&1 | tail -100"
  ```

- [ ] If critical: Execute rollback (see below)

**Issue**: "Connection refused" or SSH fails

- [ ] Verify SSH access: `ssh root@46.225.14.83 "echo OK"`
- [ ] Check network connectivity: `ping 46.225.14.83`
- [ ] Verify SSH key permissions: `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa`
- [ ] Check firewall rules

**Issue**: Services not coming up

- [ ] Wait 30 seconds (initial startup time)
- [ ] Check Ollama service: `ssh root@46.225.14.83 "curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags"`
- [ ] Check disk space: `ssh root@46.225.14.83 "df -h /"`
- [ ] Check memory: `ssh root@46.225.14.83 "free -h"`

---

### ⚠️ Post-Deployment Issues

**Issue**: Services show "Unhealthy" or "Exited"

- [ ] Check service logs: `docker logs clisonix-ocean-core | tail -50`
- [ ] Look for specific error messages
- [ ] Check if Ollama is running: `docker ps | grep ollama`
- [ ] If problem persists: Execute rollback

**Issue**: Health check timeouts still after 2 minutes

- [ ] Services may need more time to initialize
- [ ] Check process status: `docker top clisonix-ocean-core`
- [ ] Try manual health endpoint: `curl http://46.225.14.83:8030/health`
- [ ] If still failing: Check memory/CPU constraints

**Issue**: Other services stopped

- [ ] ⚠️ EMERGENCY: Execute immediate rollback
- [ ] ```bash
  ssh root@46.225.14.83 "cd /root/clisonix-cloud && git checkout docker-compose.yml && docker-compose up -d"

  ```
- [ ] Verify all services running: `docker ps`

- [ ] Investigate root cause in logs

---

## 🔄 EMERGENCY ROLLBACK PROCEDURE

**Use only if critical issues occur**

### Step 1: STOP (Do Not Panic)

- [ ] Issue identified
- [ ] Backup exists: `/root/clisonix-backups/docker-compose.yml.*`
- [ ] Ready to rollback

### Step 2: EXECUTE ROLLBACK

```bash
BACKUP_FILE=$(ssh root@46.225.14.83 "ls -t /root/clisonix-backups/docker-compose.yml.* | head -1")
ssh root@46.225.14.83 "cp $BACKUP_FILE /root/clisonix-cloud/docker-compose.yml && \
  cd /root/clisonix-cloud && \
  docker-compose down ocean-core ocean-core-multimodal ocean-core-strict-chat ocean-core-blerina && \
  docker-compose up -d"
```

- [ ] Rollback command executed
- [ ] Services restarting
- [ ] Wait 30 seconds

### Step 3: VERIFY ROLLBACK

- [ ] Check services running:

  ```bash
  ssh root@46.225.14.83 "docker ps"
  ```

- [ ] All services operational? YES / NO
- [ ] Other services running? YES / NO

### Step 4: POST-ROLLBACK

- [ ] Rollback successful ✓
- [ ] Investigate root cause
- [ ] Document issue
- [ ] Contact DevOps for analysis
- [ ] Plan for redeploy when ready

## 📞 ESCALATION PATH

**If deployment fails and you need immediate help:**

1. **Collect Information**:
   - [ ] Output of verify script in JSON format:

     ```bash
     python verify_ocean_core_v2.py --host 46.225.14.83 --json debug.json
     # Attach debug.json file
     ```

   - [ ] Last 100 lines from docker logs:

     ```bash
     ssh root@46.225.14.83 "docker logs clisonix-ocean-core | tail -100" > ocean_logs.txt
     # Attach ocean_logs.txt file
     ```

   - [ ] docker-compose version:

     ```bash
     docker-compose --version
     ```

2. **Contact DevOps** with:
   - [ ] debug.json file
   - [ ] ocean_logs.txt file
   - [ ] Command executed
