## Testing Workflow

### Automated Testing (Recommended)
```
1. Run: python orchestrate_discovery_tests.py
2. Wait: 30-40 seconds for all phases
3. Result: See "ALL TESTS PASSED" message
4. Record: Document in TEST_RESULTS_TEMPLATE.md
5. Proceed: Ready for Phase 3
```

### Manual Testing (For Deep Understanding)
```
Terminal 1: python ocean_api_server.py
Terminal 2: cd apps\api && python -m uvicorn main:app --port 8000
Terminal 3: python alba_service_5555.py
Terminal 4: python albi_service_6680.py
Terminal 5: python jona_service_7777.py

Check Logs:
  All services should log "registered in Google Firestore"

Test Discovery:
  curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/services
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/service-discovery \
    -d '{"capability":"neural-processing"}'

Validate:
  Each service appears in registry
  Each discovery query returns correct service
  Last heartbeat timestamps are recent (<30s)
```
