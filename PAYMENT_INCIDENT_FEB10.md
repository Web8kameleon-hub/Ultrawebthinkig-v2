## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### What Happened:
1. ✅ Payment session created successfully
2. ✅ Stripe Checkout form loaded
3. ✅ Card details accepted
4. ❌ 3D Secure authentication popup shown
5. ❌ Authentication failed (customer couldn't complete)

### Why This Happened:

- **PSD2/SCA Requirement:** Germany requires 3D Secure for card payments
- **Configuration:** 3D Secure not optimized in Stripe Dashboard yet
