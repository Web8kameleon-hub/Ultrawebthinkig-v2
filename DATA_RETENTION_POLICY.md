DELETE FROM user_data WHERE user_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM users);
```

### Automated Retention Jobs

``` python
# retention_service.py
from apscheduler.schedulers.background import BackgroundScheduler

scheduler = BackgroundScheduler()

@scheduler.scheduled_job('cron', hour=2, minute=0)

    """Daily deletion of logs older than 1 year"""
    db.execute("""
        DELETE FROM audit_logs 
        WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '1 year'
    """)

@scheduler.scheduled_job('cron', hour=3, minute=0)
def delete_temp_eeg_data():
    """Daily deletion of temporary EEG data"""
    db.execute("""

        WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
        AND processing_completed = true
