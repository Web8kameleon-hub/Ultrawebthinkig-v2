### Pipeline Execution

#### Stage 0: Parse
```
Input: "S0=3, S1=7, S2=11, compute S10"
Tokenized: [S0, =, 3, S1, =, 7, S2, =, 11, compute, S10]
Type: Query with initial conditions + computation request
```

#### Stage 1: Classify
```
Query Type: Arithmetic sequence problem
Complexity: Low
Required Capability: Sequence arithmetic
Priority: Standard
```

#### Stage 2: Decompose
```
Subquery 1: Identify pattern from S0, S1, S2
Subquery 2: Find common difference (d)
Subquery 3: Apply nth-term formula
Subquery 4: Compute S10
Dependencies: Linear (1→2→3→4)
```

#### Stage 3: Retrieve
```
Knowledge required:
  - Arithmetic sequence properties
  - nth-term formula: Sn = S0 + n*d
  - Common difference: d = S1 - S0
```

#### Stage 4: Apply
```
Compute difference:
  d = S1 - S0 = 7 - 3 = 4
  Verify: S2 - S1 = 11 - 7 = 4 ✓ (consistent)

Apply formula:
  S10 = S0 + 10*d
  S10 = 3 + 10*4
  S10 = 3 + 40
  S10 = 43
```

#### Stage 5: Synthesize
```
Combined result:
  Sequence: arithmetic
  First term: 3
  Common difference: 4
  10th term: 43
```

#### Stage 6: Validate
```
✓ S1 = 3 + 1*4 = 7 (matches given)
✓ S2 = 3 + 2*4 = 11 (matches given)
✓ Pattern is consistent
✓ Solution is complete
```

#### Stage 7: Format
```
Clear output structure:
  Pattern: Arithmetic sequence
  First term (S0): 3
  Common difference: 4
  Requested term: S10 = 43
```

#### Stage 8: Output
```
RESULT: S10 = 43

Trace:
  - Identified arithmetic sequence ✓
  - Common difference d = 4 ✓
  - Applied Sn = S0 + n*d ✓
