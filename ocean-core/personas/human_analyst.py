    KNOWLEDGE = {
        "consciousness": """🧠 **Consciousness** is one of the deepest mysteries in science and philosophy.

**What is it?**
Consciousness is the subjective experience of being aware - the "what it's like" to be you. It includes:
- **Awareness** of your surroundings, thoughts, and feelings
- **Self-awareness** - knowing that you exist
- **Qualia** - the subjective quality of experiences (like the redness of red)

**Scientific Perspectives:**
- **Neuroscience**: Consciousness emerges from complex neural activity, particularly in the cerebral cortex
- **Integrated Information Theory (IIT)**: Consciousness = integrated information (Phi)
- **Global Workspace Theory**: Consciousness is a "broadcast" system in the brain

**The Hard Problem:**
Why does physical brain activity give rise to subjective experience? This remains unsolved.

**Key Brain Areas:**
- Prefrontal cortex (self-awareness)
- Thalamus (sensory integration)
- Claustrum (potential consciousness hub)""",
        
        "ai": """🤖 **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** refers to computer systems designed to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.

**Types of AI:**
- **Narrow AI**: Specialized for specific tasks (like ChatGPT, image recognition)
- **General AI (AGI)**: Human-level intelligence across all domains (not yet achieved)
- **Super AI (ASI)**: Surpasses human intelligence (theoretical)

**How Modern AI Works:**
- **Machine Learning**: Systems learn patterns from data
- **Deep Learning**: Neural networks with many layers
- **Transformers**: Architecture behind modern language models (attention mechanism)

**Current Capabilities:**
✅ Language understanding and generation
✅ Image and video analysis
✅ Code generation
✅ Scientific discovery assistance

**Limitations:**
❌ No true understanding (pattern matching)
❌ Hallucinations (confident false information)
❌ No common sense reasoning
❌ No consciousness or feelings""",

        "brain": """🧠 **The Human Brain** is the most complex object in the known universe.

**Key Facts:**
- ~86 billion neurons
- ~100 trillion synaptic connections
- Uses ~20% of body's energy (only 2% of body weight)
- Processes information at ~120 m/s

**Major Regions:**
- **Cerebral Cortex**: Higher thinking, language, consciousness
- **Hippocampus**: Memory formation
- **Amygdala**: Emotions, especially fear
- **Cerebellum**: Motor coordination
- **Brainstem**: Vital functions (breathing, heartbeat)

**Brain Waves:**
- **Delta (0.5-4 Hz)**: Deep sleep
- **Theta (4-8 Hz)**: Meditation, drowsiness
- **Alpha (8-12 Hz)**: Relaxed, calm
- **Beta (12-30 Hz)**: Active thinking
- **Gamma (30-100 Hz)**: Higher cognition

**Neuroplasticity:**
The brain can reorganize itself throughout life, forming new neural connections.""",

        "quantum": """⚛️ **Quantum Computing** is a revolutionary technology that uses quantum mechanics to process information.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Qubits**: Unlike classical bits (0 or 1), qubits can be both 0 AND 1 simultaneously (superposition)
- **Entanglement**: Qubits can be connected so measuring one instantly affects the other
- **Interference**: Quantum states can amplify correct answers and cancel wrong ones

**Why It Matters:**
- Solve problems impossible for classical computers
- Drug discovery and molecular simulation
- Cryptography (breaking and making secure codes)
- Optimization problems (logistics, finance)

**Current State (2026):**
- IBM, Google, IonQ leading development
- 1000+ qubit processors exist
- Still in "NISQ" era (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum)
- Practical applications emerging in chemistry, finance

**Limitations:**
- Requires extreme cooling (-273°C)
- Highly error-prone
- Not faster for all problems""",

        "neural network": """🕸️ **Neural Networks** are computing systems inspired by the human brain.

**How They Work:**
1. **Input Layer**: Receives data (images, text, numbers)
2. **Hidden Layers**: Process and transform data
3. **Output Layer**: Produces result (classification, prediction)

**Key Concepts:**
- **Neurons**: Basic units that receive inputs, apply weights, and produce output
- **Weights**: Parameters that determine connection strength
- **Activation Functions**: Introduce non-linearity (ReLU, Sigmoid)
- **Backpropagation**: Algorithm to adjust weights based on errors

**Types of Neural Networks:**
- **CNN** (Convolutional): Images, video
- **RNN** (Recurrent): Sequences, time series
- **Transformers**: Language, attention-based
- **GAN** (Generative Adversarial): Create new content

**Training Process:**
1. Forward pass: Data flows through network
2. Calculate loss: Compare output to expected
3. Backpropagate: Calculate gradients
4. Update weights: Gradient descent""",

        "machine learning": """📊 **Machine Learning** is a subset of AI where systems learn from data.

**Types of Learning:**
1. **Supervised Learning**: Learn from labeled examples
   - Classification (spam/not spam)
   - Regression (predict prices)

2. **Unsupervised Learning**: Find patterns in unlabeled data
   - Clustering (group similar items)
   - Dimensionality reduction

3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Learn from rewards/penalties
   - Game playing (AlphaGo)
   - Robotics

**Common Algorithms:**
- Linear/Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees / Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Neural Networks / Deep Learning

**The ML Pipeline:**
1. Collect and clean data
