# Datacenter Topology (Sovereign Zones)

Date: 2026-04-16
Status: Baseline topology policy
Rule: No fake capacity or uptime claims; topology must map to real deployed assets.

## 1. Topology Objective

Define sovereign multi-zone layout for:
- Control plane resilience
- LLM and inference continuity
- Secure mesh synchronization

## 2. Zone Model

- Zone A (Primary Sovereign Core)
  - Control plane, policy engine, key management interfaces
- Zone B (Compute Expansion)
  - GPU-heavy inference and batch workloads
- Zone C (Continuity and Recovery)
  - Standby control services, replicated metadata, recovery workflows

## 3. Failure Domains

Treat each domain independently:
- Power domain
- Network domain
- Storage domain
- Identity and policy domain

A single domain failure must not collapse all zones.

## 4. Data and Control Paths

- Control-plane traffic separated from model-data traffic
- Signed sync channels between zones
- Policy updates require integrity verification before apply

## 5. Sovereignty Requirements

- Data residency enforced by policy
- Identity roots and signing keys managed under sovereign governance
- Cross-zone replication must respect residency constraints

## 6. Recovery Strategy

- RPO and RTO values must be explicitly measured and stored as evidence
- Zone C activation drills scheduled and recorded
- Recovery runbook must include rollback and integrity verification

## 7. Topology Gates

Hard NO-GO:
- Unverified replication integrity
- Missing control-plane failover path
- Single-zone dependency for identity services

GO:
- Verified failover test in defined interval
- Signed state replication validated
- Control-plane quorum preserved under one-zone loss

## 8. Evidence Requirements

Required artifacts:
- Zone inventory with role mapping
- Dependency graph for control-plane services
- Latest failover test report
- Integrity verification logs for replicated state

No artifacts means topology is not production-ready.
