# LLM Infrastructure Blueprint (Sovereign Control)

Date: 2026-04-16
Status: Execution blueprint
Rule: No fabricated model performance, no synthetic SLA claims.

## 1. Mission

Operate LLM infrastructure with sovereign controls across:
- Model lifecycle
- Routing and policy
- Identity and attestation
- Auditability and rollback

## 2. Logical Planes

- Inference Plane
  - Model serving endpoints and schedulers
- Control Plane
  - Policy engine, deployment gate, key and identity checks
- Data Plane
  - Feature, embedding, and retrieval storage
- Trust Plane
  - Attestation, signing, provenance, and audit logs

## 3. Model Lifecycle Controls

- Register model artifact with checksum and signature
- Validate provenance before promotion
- Stage rollout by traffic percentage
- Rollback automatically on hard guardrail breach

## 4. Routing Policy

- Route by workload class, latency budget, and trust level
- Enforce deny-by-default for unknown model IDs
- Policy revisions are versioned and signed

## 5. Security and PQ Readiness

- Service-to-service mTLS
- Signed request envelopes for critical control operations
- PQ migration path tracked (Kyber/Dilithium compatibility layer)

## 6. Guardrails

Hard NO-GO:
- Unsigned model artifact
- Missing provenance chain
- Failed attestation on active serving node

GO:
- All active routes policy-compliant
- Provenance and attestation checks pass
- Rollback path tested for current release

## 7. Operational Metrics (Real Only)

Track and retain:
- End-to-end request latency percentiles
- Error rate by model and route
- Token throughput by class
- Policy deny counts
- Rollback trigger events

Do not report estimated or synthetic values as production metrics.

## 8. Evidence Pack

For each release decision:
- Model artifact signature report
- Route policy diff and approval record
- Canary results with timestamped metrics
- Rollback validation output

## 9. Definition of Done

Blueprint is considered implemented when:
- Every route is policy-governed
- Every model is provenance-verified
- Every release has auditable evidence and rollback proof
