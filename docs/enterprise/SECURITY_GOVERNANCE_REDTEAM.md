# Security Posture Differentiator: Governance + Audit + Red Team

## Security Posture Pillars
1. Preventive controls (secret hygiene, static/dynamic scans)
2. Detective controls (telemetry, anomaly detection, drift checks)
3. Corrective controls (playbooks, rollback, key rotation)
4. Assurance controls (audit trail, periodic red-team)

## Policy Engine
- Policy decisions must be logged as structured events:
  - `policy_name`, `decision`, `reason`, `actor`, `resource`
- Enforce deny-by-default for unknown routes in regulated mode.

## Audit Trail Requirements
- Immutable event IDs
- Correlated request -> route -> model output -> policy decision
- Exportable JSON/CSV evidence packs for compliance requests

## Red-Team Cadence
- Weekly: prompt injection / jailbreak smoke tests
- Monthly: full adversarial scenario set (API abuse, model manipulation, data exfil simulation)
- Quarterly: external-style tabletop incident simulation

## Incident Readiness
- Severity matrix P1/P2/P3
- 24/7 on-call rota for enterprise tenants
- MTTR target tracking with postmortems

## Differentiator Message
Clisonix is positioned as enterprise-grade AI platform with governance-first operations:
- controlled routing
- explainable policy decisions
- auditable deployments and data lifecycle
