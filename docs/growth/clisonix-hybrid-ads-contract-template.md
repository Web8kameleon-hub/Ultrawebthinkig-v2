# Clisonix Hybrid Performance Ads Agreement (Template)

## Founder-Led Default (No Investors)
Use these defaults if Clisonix is bootstrapped and cashflow-sensitive:
- Monthly base retainer cap: **€400-€900**
- Initial monthly ad spend cap: **€800-€2,500**
- Pilot length: **60 days** (can extend to 90 only if KPI trend is positive)
- Performance-heavy split target: **>=70% variable compensation, <=30% fixed**
- Mandatory stop-loss: pause campaigns if no SQL within first **14 days** after launch

## 1) Parties and Scope
This Agreement is between:
- **Client**: Clisonix ("Client")
- **Agency**: [Agency Legal Name] ("Agency")

**Scope**: Paid acquisition services for B2B SaaS growth (strategy, creative testing, campaign setup, optimization, reporting).

## 2) Pilot Term and Renewal
- **Pilot term**: 60-90 days from Effective Date (Founder default: 60 days).
- **Review checkpoints**: Day 30, Day 60, Day 90.
- After pilot, either party may continue month-to-month under written confirmation.

## 3) Commercial Model (Hybrid)
### 3.1 Base Retainer (Low Floor)
- Monthly base retainer: **€[X]** (Founder default target: **€400-€900**)
- Purpose: operational execution (campaign management, reporting, experimentation).

### 3.2 Performance Bonus (Primary Compensation)
Agency earns bonuses only on validated business outcomes:

1. **Qualified Demo Booked**: €[A] per approved demo
2. **SQL (Sales Qualified Lead)**: €[B] per approved SQL
3. **New Paid Subscription**: €[C] one-time per new paid customer
4. **Net New MRR Bonus**: [D]% of first-month net new MRR attributed to Agency

Founder-friendly starting defaults (replace placeholders if needed):
- Qualified Demo: **€20-€50**
- SQL: **€80-€180**
- New Paid Subscription: **€150-€450**
- Net New MRR Bonus: **8-15%** of first-month attributable MRR

> If two bonus layers apply to the same account, payout follows this order: Demo -> SQL -> Paid -> MRR (no double counting unless explicitly approved in writing).

## 4) KPI Definitions (Binding)
- **Qualified Demo**: Meeting booked and attended by ICP account matching agreed firmographic and role criteria.
- **SQL**: Lead accepted by Sales team in CRM with status `SQL` and reason code.
- **New Paid Subscription**: First successful payment by a new account not previously paying in the last 12 months.
- **Net New MRR**: Additional monthly recurring revenue from newly converted paid accounts attributable to Agency campaigns.

## 5) Attribution Rules

- Required UTMs: `utm_source`, `utm_medium`, `utm_campaign`, `utm_content`, optional `utm_term`.
- Attribution window: **[30/60] days** from first tracked click.
- Tie-break rule (recommended): last non-direct click unless parties define multi-touch split.

No performance fee is due for:
- Spam/fraud/bot leads
